## Scope

`spec_runner` aims to stay small and stable:

- stable parsing of `yaml contract-spec` fences
- stable assertion evaluation
- minimal core kinds (adapters should live with the system under test)

## Development

See `docs/development.md`.

## Commit Messages

See `docs/commit_guidelines.md`.
