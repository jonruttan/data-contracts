# Expected Outcomes

Expected conformance results for fixtures in `../cases/`.

This directory is legacy-only while the fixture corpus is being consolidated on
inline `expect` metadata in case records.

Expected records should include:

- `id`
- `status` (`pass`/`fail`)
- `category` (`schema`/`assertion`/`runtime`)
- Store results in YAML files with top-level `results:`.
