# Generated Reference Index

## When to read this

Read this when you need machine-generated reference outputs.

## What you will do

- Use this page as the single generated-reference gateway.
- Jump to generated artifacts that are still active and useful.

## Step-by-step

1. Confirm generated outputs are up to date.
2. Navigate from this page to generated reference files.
3. If a generated file is missing, fix source contracts/manifests first.

## Common failure signals

- Generated files referenced here but missing on disk.
- Generated files drift from source manifests/contracts.

## Normative refs

- `docs/book/reference_manifest.yaml`
- `specs/02_contracts/10_docs_quality.md`
