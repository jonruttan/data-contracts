# Library Authoring

## When to read this

Read this when creating reusable policy/domain symbols.

## What you will do

- Design stable symbol contracts.
- Export symbols with clear docs and examples.

## Step-by-step

1. Define symbol behavior and expected inputs.
2. Export from library specs with deterministic IDs.
3. Add call-site examples in consuming cases.
4. Keep versioning and naming canonical.

## Common failure signals

- Symbols exported without examples.
- Incompatible symbol parameter changes without updates.
- Libraries coupled to runner-specific behavior.
