# Current Spec Snapshot

Spec-Version: 1
Date: 2026-02-12

Notes:

- The canonical assertion DSL is `must` / `can` / `cannot` with `contain`,
  `regex`, and `expr` (spec-lang v1 list S-expressions).
- `target` is defined on group nodes; leaf assertions are op-only.

Canonical spec docs:

- `docs/spec/schema/schema_v1.md`
- `docs/spec/contract/`
- `docs/spec/backlog.md`
