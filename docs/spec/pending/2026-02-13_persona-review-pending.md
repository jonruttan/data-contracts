## Implicit Suggestions (Inferred, Needs Review)

### CK-CORE-IMP-004

- where: `docs/spec/backlog.md`
- priority: `P1`
- statement: SHOULD define core mode vs full-governance mode for adoption tiers
- rationale: Inferred from repeated narrative concerns in the review output; requires human triage.
- verification: Define as yaml spec-test where possible; otherwise add a governance check with deterministic output.

### CK-CORE-IMP-006

- where: `docs/spec/backlog.md`
- priority: `P1`
- statement: SHOULD add a compact machine-readable gate summary artifact
- rationale: Inferred from repeated narrative concerns in the review output; requires human triage.
- verification: Define as yaml spec-test where possible; otherwise add a governance check with deterministic output.

### CK-CORE-IMP-008

- where: `docs/spec/backlog.md`
- priority: `P1`
- statement: SHOULD provide a lightweight adoption profile for teams that only need simple behavior checks
- rationale: Inferred from repeated narrative concerns in the review output; requires human triage.
- verification: Define as yaml spec-test where possible; otherwise add a governance check with deterministic output.

### CK-CORE-IMP-009

- where: `docs/spec/backlog.md`
- priority: `P1`
- statement: SHOULD constrain cross-runtime scope to prevent maintenance bottlenecks
- rationale: Inferred from repeated narrative concerns in the review output; requires human triage.
- verification: Define as yaml spec-test where possible; otherwise add a governance check with deterministic output.

### CK-CORE-IMP-010

- where: `docs/spec/backlog.md`
- priority: `P1`
- statement: SHOULD prevent ambient env/time assumptions from leaking into portable fixtures
- rationale: Inferred from repeated narrative concerns in the review output; requires human triage.
- verification: Define as yaml spec-test where possible; otherwise add a governance check with deterministic output.
