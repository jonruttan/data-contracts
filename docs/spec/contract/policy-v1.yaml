rules:
  - id: CLI_RUN_ENTRYPOINT_REQUIRED
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: case
    applies_to: cli.run.harness.entrypoint
    norm: MUST
    requirement: present
    description: For cli.run, harness.entrypoint must be set in each case.
    rationale: Ensures portable, explicit invocation without hidden runner state.
    risk_if_violated: Cases become environment-dependent and non-portable.

  - id: CLI_RUN_ENTRYPOINT_ENV_FALLBACK
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: implementation
    applies_to: cli.run.entrypoint_resolution
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: support_env_fallback_when_process_env_and_dynamic_entrypoint_loading_are_available
    description: >
      Implementations should support environment fallback for local/CI
      ergonomics when they can read process environment variables and resolve
      dynamic module:attribute entrypoints at runtime.
    rationale: Improves ergonomics in local and containerized workflows.
    risk_if_violated: Higher setup friction in some environments.

  - id: CLI_RUN_CONFORMANCE_EXPLICIT_ENTRYPOINT
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: conformance
    applies_to: fixtures.cli.run
    norm: MUST
    requirement: explicit_harness_entrypoint
    description: Portable conformance fixtures must set harness.entrypoint.
    rationale: Keeps parity checks independent of implementation conveniences.
    risk_if_violated: Conformance results can diverge across runtimes.

  - id: CLI_RUN_CONFORMANCE_NO_ENV_DEPENDENCY
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: conformance
    applies_to: fixtures.cli.run
    norm: MUST_NOT
    requirement: rely_on_env_fallback
    description: Portable conformance fixtures must not depend on env fallback.
    rationale: Prevents ambient-environment coupling in parity tests.
    risk_if_violated: Flaky or non-reproducible cross-language conformance.

  - id: ASSERT_HEALTH_MODE_VALID_VALUES
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: case
    applies_to: assert_health.mode
    norm: MUST
    requirement: accept_only_ignore_warn_error
    description: >
      When assert_health.mode is provided, only ignore, warn, or error are
      valid values.
    rationale: Keeps diagnostics policy deterministic and portable.
    risk_if_violated: Implementations diverge on policy interpretation.

  - id: ASSERT_HEALTH_GLOBAL_AND_PER_CASE_POLICY
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: implementation
    applies_to: assertion_health.policy_resolution
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: support_global_default_and_per_case_override
    description: >
      Implementations should support both a global default policy and a
      per-case override for assertion-health diagnostics.
    rationale: Enables gradual rollout and targeted strictness.
    risk_if_violated: Hard to adopt diagnostics without broad breakage.

  - id: ASSERT_HEALTH_REDUNDANT_BRANCH_DIAGNOSTIC
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: case
    applies_to: assert.tree.group_children
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: detect_redundant_sibling_branches
    description: >
      Implementations should diagnose redundant sibling assertion branches
      within a group (`must`, `can`, `cannot`) and surface them via
      assertion-health policy modes.
    rationale: Redundant branches hide intent and create maintenance noise.
    risk_if_violated: Specs can pass while carrying misleading duplicate logic.

  - id: ASSERT_HEALTH_NON_PORTABLE_REGEX_DIAGNOSTIC
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: case
    applies_to: assert.tree.regex
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: detect_non_portable_regex_constructs
    description: >
      Implementations should diagnose regex patterns that use non-portable
      constructs and surface them via assertion-health policy modes.
    rationale: Preserves cross-language determinism and reduces portability drift.
    risk_if_violated: Specs may pass in one runtime and fail in another.

  - id: DOC_NORMATIVE_PAGE_TRACEABILITY
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: governance
    applies_to: docs.spec.contract.normative_pages
    norm: MUST
    requirement: every_normative_contract_page_has_traceability_coverage
    description: >
      Every normative contract page must be covered by at least one
      traceability contract_ref entry.
    rationale: Prevents contract pages from drifting stale without governance signal.
    risk_if_violated: Normative docs can silently diverge from enforced behavior.

  - id: DOC_REGEX_PROFILE_LINKAGE

    scope: governance
    applies_to: docs.spec.regex_portability_profile
    norm: MUST
    requirement: regex_portability_profile_linked_in_assertions_schema_and_policy
    description: >
      The regex portability profile doc must be explicitly referenced by the
      assertion contract, schema, and policy.
    rationale: Keeps portability constraints visible at all normative layers.
    risk_if_violated: Portability guidance can be orphaned and ignored by implementers.

  - id: DOC_ASSERTION_OPERATOR_DOC_SYNC
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: governance
    applies_to: docs.spec.assertion_operators
    norm: MUST
    requirement: core_assertion_operator_tokens_synced_between_contract_and_schema
    description: >
      Core assertion operator names must remain synchronized between assertion
      contract docs and schema docs.
    rationale: Prevents stale naming drift between reader-oriented and schema docs.
    risk_if_violated: Users and implementers follow conflicting operator names.

  - id: CONFORMANCE_EXPECT_OVERLAY_RESOLUTION
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: conformance
    applies_to: fixtures.expect
    norm: MUST
    requirement: resolve_expectations_portable_then_impl_overlay
    description: >
      When conformance cases define inline expect metadata, implementations must
      resolve expected outcomes by starting from expect.portable and then
      overlaying expect.impl.<implementation> keys.
    rationale: Keeps portable intent primary while allowing explicit runtime deltas.
    risk_if_violated: Implementations drift on expectation resolution semantics.

  - id: CONFORMANCE_CASE_STYLE_GUARD
    introduced_in: v1
    scope: governance
    applies_to: fixtures.conformance.cases_style
    norm: MUST
    requirement: enforce_conformance_case_authoring_style
    description: >
      Conformance case docs must follow readability/style constraints enforced
      by governance checks (one case per block, heading alignment, sorted ids,
      bounded block size).
    rationale: Keeps conformance specs readable and reviewable as the corpus grows.
    risk_if_violated: Fixture docs become noisy and brittle to maintain.
