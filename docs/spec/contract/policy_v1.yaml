    description: >
      Implementations should support environment fallback for local/CI
      ergonomics when they can read process environment variables and resolve
      dynamic module:attribute entrypoints at runtime.
    rationale: Improves ergonomics in local and containerized workflows.
    risk_if_violated: Higher setup friction in some environments.

      Conformance fixtures should prefer `evaluate` (spec-lang) assertions as
