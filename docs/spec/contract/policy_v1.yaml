    introduced_in: v1
    scope: case
    applies_to: cli.run.harness.entrypoint
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: prefer_present
    description: For cli.run, harness.entrypoint should be set in each case.
    rationale: Keeps invocation explicit and reduces environment coupling.
    risk_if_violated: Cases can become environment-dependent outside conformance.

    scope: implementation
    applies_to: cli.run.safe_mode
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: disable_hooks_and_env_fallback_when_safe_mode_enabled
    description: >
      Implementations should provide a safe mode that disables hook entrypoints
      and entrypoint env fallback for `cli.run`.
    rationale: Reduces code-execution risk for hardened or semi-trusted workflows.
    risk_if_violated: Untrusted or mixed-trust specs have higher exploitability.

    scope: implementation
    applies_to: cli.run.process_environment
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: support_allowlist_for_inherited_environment
    description: >
      Implementations should provide a control to limit inherited process
      environment variables passed to cli.run executions.
    rationale: Limits accidental secret exposure from ambient CI/dev shells.
    risk_if_violated: Commands under test can read unrelated sensitive env.

    scope: implementation
    applies_to: cli.run.entrypoint_resolution
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: support_env_fallback_when_process_env_and_dynamic_entrypoint_loading_are_available
    description: >
      Implementations should support environment fallback for local/CI
      ergonomics when they can read process environment variables and resolve
      dynamic module:attribute entrypoints at runtime.
    rationale: Improves ergonomics in local and containerized workflows.
    risk_if_violated: Higher setup friction in some environments.

    norm: MUST
    requirement: explicit_harness_entrypoint
    description: Portable conformance fixtures must set harness.entrypoint.
    rationale: Keeps parity checks independent of implementation conveniences.

    applies_to: fixtures.cli.run
    norm: MUST_NOT
    requirement: rely_on_env_fallback
    description: Portable conformance fixtures must not depend on env fallback.
    rationale: Prevents ambient-environment coupling in parity tests.
    risk_if_violated: Flaky or non-reproducible cross-language conformance.

    norm: MUST
    requirement: accept_only_ignore_warn_error
    description: >
      When assert_health.mode is provided, only ignore, warn, or error are
      valid values.
    rationale: Keeps diagnostics policy deterministic and portable.
    risk_if_violated: Implementations diverge on policy interpretation.

    requirement: support_global_default_and_per_case_override
    description: >
      Implementations should support both a global default policy and a
      per-case override for assertion-health diagnostics.
    rationale: Enables gradual rollout and targeted strictness.
    risk_if_violated: Hard to adopt diagnostics without broad breakage.

    scope: case
    applies_to: assert.tree.group_children
    norm: SHOULD
    requirement: detect_redundant_sibling_branches
    description: >
      Implementations should diagnose redundant sibling assertion branches
      within a group (`must`, `can`, `cannot`) and surface them via
      assertion-health policy modes.
    rationale: Redundant branches hide intent and create maintenance noise.
    risk_if_violated: Specs can pass while carrying misleading duplicate logic.

    description: >
      Implementations should diagnose regex patterns that use non-portable
      constructs and surface them via assertion-health policy modes.
    rationale: Preserves cross-language determinism and reduces portability drift.

    description: >
      Implementations must provide proper tail-call optimization for
      tail-position `call` expressions.
    rationale: Avoids host-stack-dependent failures in portable recursive specs.
    risk_if_violated: Tail-recursive cases can fail by recursion depth.

    description: >
      Evaluators must enforce steps, nodes, literal-size, and optional timeout
      budgets for expression execution.
    rationale: Provides deterministic failure bounds for recursive expressions.

    description: >
      Spec-lang expression failures must map to schema/assertion/runtime
      categories consistently across implementations.

    description: >
      Every normative contract page must be covered by at least one
      traceability contract_ref entry.

    description: >
      Core assertion operator names must remain synchronized between assertion
      contract docs and schema docs.

    description: >
      When conformance cases define inline expect metadata, implementations must
      resolve expected outcomes by starting from expect.portable and then

      Conformance case docs must follow readability/style constraints enforced
      by governance checks (one case per block, heading alignment, sorted ids,
      bounded block size).
    rationale: Keeps conformance specs readable and reviewable as the corpus grows.

      Portable, implementation-independent behavior coverage must live in the
