# Spec Backlog

This is a lightweight queue of spec work to draft next.

Pending specs live in `docs/spec/pending/` as individual files with frontmatter
metadata (id/title/priority).

Sorting: Items are ordered top-to-bottom by priority (`P0` then `P1` then `P2`).
Within the same priority, order reflects dependency/throughput (shared tooling
and low-risk scaffolding first).
