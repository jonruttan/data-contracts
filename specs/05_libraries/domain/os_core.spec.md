          Purpose: Documents behavior for `domain.os.exec_ok` for this audience, including input contract, output contract, and failure modes.

          Inputs:
          - Inputs are the fixture inputs bound to this docs-bearing symbol as declared in the owning export or case entry.
          - Runtime bindings and policy constraints are applied by the harness before execution. 

          Returns:
          - Returns the assertion/helper value emitted by this symbol after bindings and policy checks execute.

          Errors/Caveats:
          - Input/shape mismatches are surfaced as validation failures. 
          - Schema, runtime binding, or environment mismatches are surfaced as runtime or validation failures.
          - Policy and validation failures are surfaced through contract evaluation, including policy assertions and policy checks.

          Usage context:
          - Use this for implementation work, local debugging, and runner-side behavior analysis.

        outputs:

        caveats:
        - Invocation defaults and ordering must match contract expectations for deterministic behavior.
        - Environment-sensitive references can change runtime outcome if not explicitly provided.
        examples:
        - Test the symbol with known-valid data and a representative invalid input to verify both pass/fail behavior.
        inputs:
        - Contract parameters and required case inputs associated with this docs-bearing

        returns:

        Purpose: Documents behavior for `domain.os.exec_ok` for this audience, including input contract, output contract, and failure modes.

        Inputs:
        - Inputs are the fixture inputs bound to this docs-bearing symbol as declared in the owning export or case entry.
        - Runtime bindings and policy constraints are applied by the harness before execution. 

        Returns:
        - Returns the assertion/helper value emitted by this symbol after bindings and policy checks execute.

        Errors/Caveats:
        - Input/shape mismatches are surfaced as validation failures. 
        - Schema, runtime binding, or environment mismatches are surfaced as runtime or validation failures.
        - Policy and validation failures are surfaced through contract evaluation, including policy assertions and policy checks.

        Usage context:
        - Use this for policy gating, approval review, and compliance checks.

      outputs:
      - The normalized output produced by this docs-bearing symbol for the owning suite context.
      caveats:
      - Invocation order and default arguments may influence determinism if not explicitly controlled.
      - Environment-sensitive paths/services can produce different output on non-equivalent runner setups.
      examples:
      - Use this export in its owning fixture case to verify expected pass/fail behavior on representative success and validation-failure inputs.
