          Purpose: Documents behavior for `policy.metric_non_increase` for this audience, including input contract, output contract, and failure modes.

          Inputs:
          - Inputs are the fixture inputs bound to this docs-bearing symbol as declared in the owning export or case entry.
          - Runtime bindings and policy constraints are applied by the harness before execution. 

          Returns:
          - Returns the assertion/helper value emitted by this symbol after bindings and policy checks execute.

          Errors/Caveats:
          - Input/shape mismatches are surfaced as validation failures. 
          - Schema, runtime binding, or environment mismatches are surfaced as runtime or validation failures.
          - Policy and validation failures are surfaced through contract evaluation, including policy assertions and policy checks.

        outputs:

        caveats:

        - Environment-sensitive references can change runtime outcome if not explicitly provided.
