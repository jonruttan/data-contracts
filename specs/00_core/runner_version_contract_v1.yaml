      notes:
        - "Optional runner command state surface (refresh/status/versions/use/rollback/verify/clean/info/prune) can update/cache specs without requiring `dc-runner` binary upgrades."
        - "Optional commands are discoverable in `runner_entrypoints_v1.yaml` with `visibility: hidden` and are not required for baseline interoperability."
